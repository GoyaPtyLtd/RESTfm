This directory should contain .ini files in the same format as the top
level RESTfm.ini file. This allows for overriding any default configuration in
RESTfm.ini without the needing to edit it directly (i.e. future upgrades that
might overwrite RESTfm.ini will not cause loss of site customisations).
